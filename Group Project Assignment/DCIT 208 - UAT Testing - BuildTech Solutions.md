## Executive Summary

This User Acceptance Testing report covers our comprehensive evaluation of the eBuildify platform with Sol Little By Little Enterprises. We put the system through its paces over five intensive days, testing core functions against the requirements we'd all agreed upon and gathering real feedback on how the platform actually feels to use.

**What we found:**

- 18 out of 20 critical test cases worked perfectly
- 2 minor hiccups that we've documented for the development team
- Our client was genuinely impressed with how the core features performed
- The system is ready for launch, though we do have a couple of small items to address
