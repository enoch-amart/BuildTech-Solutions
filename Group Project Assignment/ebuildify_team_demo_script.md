## Problem Statement & Solution Overview (1 minute)

**[CHARLES - Product Owner continues]**

_[Screen: Problem slide with statistics]_

"Sol Little By Little Enterprises was losing 25% of potential sales due to manual processes. 90% of their orders came through phone calls and WhatsApp, causing errors, delays, and inventory discrepancies.

Our solution addresses these challenges through:

- Ghana Card verification for enhanced trust
- Multi-payment gateway integration
- Professional construction services
- Real-time inventory management
- Distance-based delivery pricing

This isn't just an e-commerce platform - it's a complete digital transformation that combines materials procurement with professional services, setting new industry standards in Ghana."

## System Architecture & DevOps (45 seconds)

**[ENOCH - Scrum Master & DevOps]**

_[Screen: Architecture diagram]_

"As Scrum Master and DevOps Engineer, I architected our deployment pipeline and managed our development workflow. Our system uses:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with React 18, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express APIs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated deployment from GitHub with 99.5% uptime

_[Screen: GitHub actions or deployment dashboard]_

I implemented continuous integration that automatically tests and deploys code changes. Our infrastructure scales to handle 500+ concurrent users, and we achieved sub-3-second page load times even on 3G networks.

The DevOps pipeline ensures zero-downtime deployments and automatic rollbacks if issues are detected."

## Backend Architecture & APIs (1 minute)

**[ABDUL - Backend Developer]**

_[Screen: API documentation or Postman/backend logs]_

"I'm Abdul Rashid, Backend Developer. Let me show you the robust API architecture powering eBuildify.

_[Screen: API calls in action]_

Our backend handles complex integrations:

- **Payment Processing:** Flutterwave integration with MTN MoMo, Vodafone Cash, and Telecel APIs
- **Ghana Card Verification:** Secure identity verification system
- **Inventory Management:** Real-time stock synchronization with automatic reservation during checkout
- **Credit Management:** Automated payment deduction with penalty calculations

_[Show live API calls]_

Watch as I demonstrate a live order placement - you can see the API orchestrating payment processing, inventory updates, and SMS notifications simultaneously. The system handles payment failures gracefully with automatic retries and customer notifications.

Our APIs are RESTful, well-documented, and designed for scalability across multiple regions."

## Frontend Implementation & User Experience (1 minute)

**[JERRY - Frontend Developer]**

_[Screen: Live website navigation]_

"I'm Jerry Jabari, Frontend Developer. Let me showcase the user interface that brings our backend to life.

_[Navigate through the website]_

Our frontend is built with Next.js and features:

- **Mobile-first responsive design** - 85% of our users are on mobile
- **Progressive Web App capabilities** - offline cart functionality for low-connectivity areas
- **Dynamic filtering system** - users can find products quickly with intelligent search

_[Show mobile view and desktop comparison]_

Notice how seamlessly the interface adapts between devices. The cart persists even when users lose connection, and when they're back online, everything syncs automatically.

_[Demonstrate search and filtering]_

The search handles both English and local Ghanaian product names, with auto-suggestions appearing in under 200ms. Benjamin and I collaborated closely to ensure the frontend perfectly integrates with our backend APIs."

---

## Full Stack Integration & Advanced Features (45 seconds)

**[BENJAMIN - Full Stack Developer]**

_[Screen: Live feature demonstration]_

"I'm Benjamin Acheampong, Full Stack Developer. I bridged our frontend and backend to create seamless user experiences.

_[Show contractor portal and credit system]_

Watch this contractor portal I developed - it demonstrates project tagging, bulk discount calculations, and credit term applications. When a contractor places an order for 100+ units, the 1.5% discount applies automatically.

_[Show professional services booking]_

I also integrated our professional services module where customers can book architectural drawings, quantity surveying, and construction supervision. This full-stack integration makes eBuildify unique - we're not just selling materials, we're providing complete construction solutions.

The credit management system I built automatically deducts payments from multiple account sources with penalty calculations for late payments."

## UI/UX Design & User Research (45 seconds)

**[TIMEON - UI/UX Designer]**

_[Screen: Design mockups or user journey flow]_

"I'm Timeon Able, UI/UX Designer and Documentation Specialist. My research with Sol Little By Little's customers shaped our design decisions.

_[Show before/after designs or user flow]_

Key design insights:

- **Familiar navigation** - modeled after Jumia to reduce learning curve
- **Trust indicators** - Ghana Card verification prominently displayed
- **Local payment preferences** - mobile money options front and center

_[Show documentation or style guide]_

I documented our entire design system and user research findings. The checkout completion rate during UAT was 95% because users found the interface intuitive and trustworthy.

Our bilingual approach prepares the platform for Twi integration, addressing 60% of our target market who prefer local language interaction."

## Quality Assurance & Testing Results (45 seconds)

**[JIMBA - QA Engineer]**

_[Screen: Testing dashboard or UAT results]_

"I'm Jimba Muzamil, QA Engineer and Testing Lead. I ensured eBuildify meets production standards through comprehensive testing.

_[Show testing metrics]_

Our quality metrics:

- **Test Coverage:** 85% automated test coverage
- **UAT Results:** 90% pass rate across 20 critical scenarios
- **Performance:** All pages load under 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Security:** Zero critical vulnerabilities in PCI-DSS compliance audit

_[Show UAT feedback]_

During User Acceptance Testing with Sol Little By Little, we achieved 4.7/5 client satisfaction. The two minor issues we identified - SMS notification consistency and browser-specific payment display - don't affect core business operations.

I coordinated with the entire team to ensure every feature works flawlessly across different devices, browsers, and network conditions."
